# Visualizing Indirect Effects

This is a Quarto website for visualizing indirect effects in causal inference and network analyses. The website showcases a new visualization method for interpreting direct and indirect effects across various ecological case studies.

## About

This website presents a visualization method for indirect effects developed by Allen Bush-Beaupré, Simon Coroller-Chouraki, and Marc Bélisle from the Université de Sherbrooke. The method leverages commonly used software such as [`marginaleffects`](https://marginaleffects.com/) and [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2-book.org/) to make indirect effects easier to interpret and can be seamlessly integrated into most analysis workflows.

## Website Content

The website includes:

- **Home**: Introduction to the visualization method with abstract and overview
- **Simulations**: Demonstrations of the method using simulated data for simple use cases
- **Case Study - Blowfly larvae**: Real-world application using Tree Swallows (*Tachycineta bicolor*) and their ectoparasites (*Protocalliphora* spp.)
- **Case Study - Bighorn Sheep**: Complex multi-mediator example examining carry-over effects of snow cover on bighorn sheep (*Ovis canadensis*) body mass
